# genmake

A quickly put together makefile generator for c++ play grounds.

Implemented in Go.

### Install:

$ go install github.com/ellemouton/genmake

### Run:

From your project directory (where you have some '.cpp' and '.h' files), run:

$ genmake <executableName>

or (for default executable name):

$ genmake

Then you can run 'make' and 'make clean' and continue with your c++ adventures.
